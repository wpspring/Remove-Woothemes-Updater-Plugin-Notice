Remove the WooThemes Updater Plugin Notice from WordPress Admin.

## Description

This plugin makes it easy to remove the WooThemes Updater Plugin Notice from the top of your WordPress Admin page, for
WooCommerce 3.0x and below. Formerly, WooCommerce premium plugins prompted installation of the WooCommerce Helper and
thereafter, displayed license warnings in WP-Admin headers. This plugin will remove those notices.

If you're running WooCommerce 3.1 or above, you no longer need to install this plugin as all license messaging has
moved to within the WooCommerce settings area.

As of WooCommerce 3.3.1, there is a Connect Your Store to woocommerce.com notice. To remove this notice,
please try the [WPSpring Remove WooCommerce Connect Your Store Notice plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpspring-remove-woocommerce-connect-your-store-notice/).

## Installation

Upload the plugin to your blog, Activate it.

That's it! The WooThemes Updater Plugin Notice will no longer display.
